/**
 * ORCHA §bg-child-sessions p7 — Stop-hook guard.
 *
 * Structural catch-all for the "silently died" incident class: an agent that
 * launches background work via a spawn path the Step-0 gate doesn't cover
 * (e.g. improvising with the `Workflow` tool instead of loading the swarm
 * skill), then ends its turn seconds later. Under streaming mode, keep-alive
 * is off (see `resolveKeepBackgroundTasksAlive`), so subprocess teardown
 * kills anything still in-query — with zero indicator to the model that it
 * happened.
 *
 * This module is the pure decision function only — no SDK types, no hook
 * plumbing. `claude-agent.ts` owns the SDK `Stop` hook wiring and the
 * per-turn `runningInQueryTaskIds` set; it calls `buildStopHookGuardDecision`
 * with a plain snapshot of that state so the branching logic is testable
 * without a live SDK query.
